# c-StateMachineExample
A Simple Implementation of a simple Finite State Machine in C language.
Project created in Code::Blocks IDE, but it can be even used in Embedded Systems.

Based on work by J. L. Garbini.

In this example, a simple washing machine cycle was modelled. Can be adapted for any another cycle made by sequenced well defined steps.
This state machine example was based on the following flowchart:
